# My Portfolio
Here is the repo for my current website portfolio.

## About the Project
It is composed of a homepage, portfolio page, contact page, and link to my resume. In the future, I plan on adding additional pages such as an about me page as well as additional projects. The goal of the project was to have very simple but smooth styling. In addition, I practiced with breakpoints and alot of flexbox. I plan to add more interactivity to the website in theh future.

## Technology
It is made in HTML, CSS, and PHP. Not a whole lot of PHP. It was mostly made w/ HTML and CSS. (PHP used for form handling).
